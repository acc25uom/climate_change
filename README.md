This programming file calculates the direct and indirect effects of climate change on health and economy by using a multiple linear model.   The climate change can affect the health directly such as through exposure to droughts, dry climate, flooding or spread of infectious diseases, but can also indirectly impact health via economic effects, a relationship complicated by unseen factors that might skew the understanding of the policymakers regardless of whether there are used sophisticated statistical models or machine learning techniques.  In this example, the health outcome is death due to alcohol consumption per year between 2010 and 2023 in U.K..  The status of economy is given by either the total Gross Domestic Product (GDP), GDP  from agriculture, or GDP  from manufacturing, and for the same period of time 2010 to 2023 and the same country (U.K.).   The numerical results show some clear positive direct and indirect effects of the climate change on the health outcome especially when the GDP from agriculture is used as a mediator variable between climate change and health output, which may underline the effects that climate change can have on the agriculture.
